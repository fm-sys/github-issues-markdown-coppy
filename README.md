#### Update 10.12.2020: 
Due to website changes on GitHub this user script will not work any more. Since I don't use it myself anymore and therefore won't maintain it for now it's going into the archive. Maybe it will be brought out again sometime by me or someone else ;-)

# github userscript: markdown coppy for issues and pull requests
A button for copy name &amp; number with attached link in markdown style

## install
Click here to install the [userscript](https://github.com/fm-sys/github-issues-markdown-coppy/raw/master/git%20markdown%20copy.user.js). That's all!

Note: You will need [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to install it.
